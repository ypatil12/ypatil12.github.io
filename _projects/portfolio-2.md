In the summer of 2019, I worked as a blockchain intern at Samsung Research America. My research  centered around two problems:
1. Account & Identity Management systems stores on centralized servers are vulnerable to attacks (honeypots, rainbow tables to compromise low entropy passwords, insecure key management, etc)
2. It's difficult to use one's own account/identity across different platforms.

Naturally, our goal was to build a system that could manage a user's accounts with a *decentralized system* that could be used across platforms. Essentially a Decentralized Identity (DID) protocol.

This paper was my first in-depth research paper in crypto. The basis of this paper was eventually used by Samsung in a Patent Application. Note that this paper was written 3 years ago and significant portions of the paper are outdated (eg. Using a shard and beacon chain for scaling). Portions of the paper have been redacted.
