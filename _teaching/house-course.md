Taught over 40 students the basics of crypto from first principles.

At Duke, I taught a house course about blockchain and DeFi my Sophomore and Senior years to undergraduates across all majors. The course was sponsored through the Duke Blockchain Lab and went in depth into consensus, cryptography, DeFi primitives, scaling solutions, and the philosophy of money. 

A selection of presentations from the course can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15oJJ5jAhM69gw0ra4-gAg-ft_OXgUwqW?usp=sharing) with corresponding [lecture notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i3BnlhsuSE_kX1FwfmeLUDZafCO-qJoxK-7Oifvn4BE/edit?usp=sharing).
