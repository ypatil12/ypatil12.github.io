My name is Yash and I'm currently a Smart Contract Engineer at [Ondo Finance](https://ondo.finance). 

I recently graduated from Duke, where I studied CS and PPE. In college, I spent time working as a software engineer at [AlphaPoint](https://alphapoint.com) and as a researcher at Samsung Research America working on an [Identity Protocol](https://ypatil12.github.io/projects/portfolio-2/). At school, I ran the Duke Blockchain Lab, where I [taught](https://ypatil12.github.io/teaching/house-course) 40+ undergrads and TA'd an [MBA Crypto Course](https://ypatil12.github.io/teaching/innovation-cryptoventures). I also conducted [research](https://ypatil12.github.io/projects/portfolio-1/) at the intersection of consensus algorithms and RL with Dr. Kartik Nayak. 

After I graduated, I had a shorts stint at [SteadyState Finance](https://www.steadystate.finance), a DeFi insurance startup, and Microsoft, as a PM on the Xbox. I now work at Ondo, where in addition to being a solidity engineer, I design our new products (some of my research can be found in Blog Post).

What I'm Thinking About:
- Applying [Everlasting Options](https://ondo.finance) to [RMMs](https://stanford.edu/~guillean/papers/rmms.pdf): WIP
- Using NFTs in the real world: [Post](https://ypatil12.github.io/posts/NFT-Verification/)

What I'm Reading:
- Who Gets What and Why (Alvin Roth)
- Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives (John Hull)
