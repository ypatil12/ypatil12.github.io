I'm currently a Smart Contract Engineer at [Ondo Finance](https://ondo.finance). 

I recently graduated from Duke, where I studied CS and PPE. In college, I spent time interning as as software engineer building cryptocurrency exchanges at [AlphaPoint](https://alphapoint.com) and as a researcher developing an [Identity Protocol](https://ypatil12.github.io/projects/portfolio-2/) at Samsung Research America. At school, I ran the Duke Blockchain Lab, where I [built](https://ypatil12.github.io/teaching/house-course) a course taken by 40+ undergrads and TA'd an [MBA Crypto Course](https://ypatil12.github.io/teaching/innovation-cryptoventures). I also conducted [research](https://ypatil12.github.io/projects/portfolio-1/) at the intersection of consensus algorithms and reinforcement learning with Dr. Kartik Nayak. 

After I graduated, I had a short stint at [SteadyState Finance](https://www.steadystate.finance), a DeFi insurance startup, and Microsoft, as a PM on the Xbox. I now work at Ondo, where in addition to being a solidity engineer, I help design our new products (some of my research can be found in Blog Post).
